</h5>

## üîñ Description
It is a game with an idea based on the game "[Among Us](https://www.innersloth.com/games/among-us/)" but with some different mechanisms, the purpose of making this game is to elaborate the practical work part 2 for the subject "_[Game Development Techniques](https://web.ipca.pt/guiaects/main/getpdf/uc/10503/lang/en)_" (GDT) of the course of "_[Digital Games Development Engineering](https://est.ipca.pt/en/curso/digital-games-development/)_" (DGDE), proposed by the teacher Daniel Nogueira.

## üïπ Game
The game is very simple, if you are a citizen, you just have to find out who the traitor is and thus expel him from the town. If you are a traitor, the goal is to deceive the people by getting them to expel themselves or even eliminate them.

### ‚å®Ô∏è Keys
The keys are very simple, you only play with the keyboard and don't require a mouse to do the actions, when there are multiple actions in a short space, you can click "_Tab_" to alternate the actions. Here is a list of the keys that the game has:
* **WASD**: To control the character
* **Tab**: To switch the actions
* **E**: To activate the selected action

### ‚öôÔ∏è Development
In this game contains the base game located in the "[Game](TTG-Game)" folder and then also contains the server part which is located in the "[Server](TTG-Server)" folder, the "[Shared](TTG-Shared)" is for sharing packets and the like so as not to duplicate code and to be reusable between the game and server.

> All the content of the graphic design / audio part was not made by me, I just downloaded them from the internet to have something as an example and not to waste too much time with the design.
